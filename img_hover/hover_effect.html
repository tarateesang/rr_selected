            Work/Play section: this effect is done by placing a contained image and an overlay div inside a main container, which controls the hover effects of this component.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            To make it look like the Work/Play section proposed, simply create and style more divs inside the parent container, except instead of them appearing on hover, make them visible at all times.

            The zoom-in effect was done by placing a contained image inside a container, which controls the effects when hovered over. Overall, it is the same component as the example above, just without the overlay div.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You can also zoom into the image by hovering over this text. As this zoom-in effect is done for
            <strong>
                only clickable article thumbnails
            </strong>
            , there will be an accompanying title link. This effect will not be present anywhere else in Robb Report.

                    For larger photos (i.e. this size) - zoom of

                    </strong>
                    is better.
