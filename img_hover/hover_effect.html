            Work/Play section: this effect is done by placing a contained image and an overlay div inside a main container, which controls the hover effects of this component. 
            <br/><br/>To make it look like the Work/Play section proposed, simply create and style more divs inside the parent container, except instead of them appearing on hover, make them visible at all times.

            The zoom-in effect was done by placing a contained image inside a container, which controls the effects when hovered over. Overall, it is the same component as the example above, just without the overlay div.
